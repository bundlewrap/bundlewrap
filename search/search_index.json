Even within BundleWrap itself (e.g. templates, libs, and hooks) you are often given repo and/or node objects to work with. Their methods and attributes are documented below. Some general notes on using BundleWrap's API: There can be an arbitrary amount of bundlewrap.repo.Repository objects per process. Repositories are read as needed and not re-read when something changes. Modifying files in a repo during the lifetime of the matching Repository object may result in undefined behavior. Example Here's a short example of how to use BundleWrap to get the uptime for a node. from bundlewrap.repo import Repository repo = Repository(\"/path/to/my/repo\") node = repo.get_node(\"mynode\") uptime = node.run(\"uptime\") print(uptime.stdout) Reference bundlewrap.repo.Repository(path) The starting point of any interaction with BundleWrap. An object of this class represents the repository at the given path. path can be a subpath of your repository (e.g., bundles/nginx/ ) and will internally be resolved to the root path of said repository. .branch The current git branch of this repo. None if not in a git repo. .clean Boolean indicating if there are uncommitted changes in git. None if not in a git repo. .groups A list of all groups in the repo (instances of bundlewrap.group.Group ) .nodes A list of all nodes in the repo (instances of bundlewrap.node.Node ) .revision The current git, hg or bzr revision of this repo. None if no SCM was detected. .get_group(group_name) Returns the Group object for the given name. .get_node(node_name) Returns the Node object with the given name. .nodes_in_all_groups(group_names) Returns a list of Node objects where every node is a member of every group name given. .nodes_in_any_group(group_names) Returns all Node objects that are a member of at least one of the given group names. .nodes_in_group(group_name) Returns a list of Node objects in the named group. bundlewrap.node.Node() A system managed by BundleWrap. .bundles A list of all bundles associated with this node (instances of bundlewrap.bundle.Bundle ) .groups A list of bundlewrap.group.Group objects this node belongs to .hostname The DNS name BundleWrap uses to connect to this node .items A list of items on this node (instances of subclasses of bundlewrap.items.Item ) .magic_number A large number derived from the node's name. This number is very likely to be unique for your entire repository. You can, for example, use this number to easily \"jitter\" cronjobs: '{} {} * * * root /my/script'.format( node.magic_number % 60, node.magic_number % 2 + 4, ) .metadata A dictionary of custom metadata, merged from information in nodes.py and groups.py .name The internal identifier for this node .download(remote_path, local_path) Downloads a file from the node. remote_path Which file to get from the node local_path Where to put the file .get_item(item_id) Get the Item object with the given ID (e.g. \"file:/etc/motd\"). .has_bundle(bundle_name) True if the node has a bundle with the given name. .has_any_bundle(bundle_names) True if the node has a bundle with any of the given names. .in_group(group_name) True if the node is in a group with the given name. .in_any_group(group_names) True if the node is in a group with any of the given names. .run(command, may_fail=False) Runs a command on the node.

These objects are returned from the \"vault\" attached to Repository objects: >>> repo.vault.password_for(\"demo\") <bundlewrap.utils.Fault object at 0x10782b208> Only when the value property of a Fault is accessed or when the Fault is converted to a string, the callback function is executed. In the example above, this means that the password is only generated when it is really required (e.g. when used in a template). This is particularly useful when used in metadata in connection with secrets . Users will be able to generate metadata with Faults in it, even if they lack the required keys for the decryption operation represented by the Fault. The key will only be required for files etc. that actually use it. If a Fault cannot be resolved (e.g. for lack of the required key), BundleWrap can just skip the item using the Fault, while still allowing other items on the same node to be applied.

This page is not meant as a complete reference. It provides a starting point to explore the various subcommands. If you're looking for details, --help is your friend. bw apply bw apply -i mynode The most important and most used part of BundleWrap, bw apply will apply your configuration to a set of nodes . By default, it operates in a non-interactive mode. When you're trying something new or are otherwise unsure of some changes, use the -i switch to have BundleWrap interactively ask before each change is made. bw run $ bw run mygroup \"uname -a\" Unsurprisingly, the run subcommand is used to run commands on nodes. As with most commands that accept node names, you can also give a group name or any combination of node and group names, separated by commas (without spaces, e.g. node1,group2,node3 ). A third option is to use a bundle selector like bundle:my_bundle . It will select all nodes with the named bundle . You can freely mix and match node names, group names, and bundle selectors. Negation is also possible for bundles and groups. !bundle:foo will add all nodes without the foo bundle, while !group:foo will add all nodes that aren't in the foo group. bw debug $ bw debug bundlewrap X.Y.Z interactive repository inspector > You can access the current repository as 'repo'. >>> len(repo.nodes) 121 This command will drop you into a Python shell with direct access to BundleWrap's API .

The above command will create an SVG file (you can open these in your browser) that shows the item dependency graph for the given node.

You may only use this for caching purposes (e.g. storing rendered file template content while the \"real\" sdict information only contains a hash of this content). BundleWrap will ignore these keys and hide them from the user. The type restrictions noted above do not apply. Step 1: Create an item module Create a new file called /your/bundlewrap/repo/items/foo.py . You can use this as a template: from bundlewrap.items import Item class Foo(Item): \"\"\" A foo. \"\"\" BUNDLE_ATTRIBUTE_NAME = \"foo\" ITEM_ATTRIBUTES = { 'attribute': \"default value\", } ITEM_TYPE_NAME = \"foo\" REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES = ['attribute'] @classmethod def block_concurrent(cls, node_os, node_os_version): \"\"\" Return a list of item types that cannot be applied in parallel with this item type. \"\"\" return [] def __repr__(self): return \"<Foo attribute:{}>\".format(self.attributes['attribute']) def cdict(self): \"\"\" Return a statedict that describes the target state of this item as configured in the repo (mnemonic: _c_dict for _config_ dict).

If your bundle looks like this: foo = { [...] } ...then you should put BUNDLE_ATTRIBUTE_NAME = \"foo\" here. ITEM_ATTRIBUTES is a dictionary of the attributes users will be able to configure for your item. For files, that would be stuff like owner, group, and permissions. Every attribute (even if it's mandatory) needs a default value, None is totally acceptable: ITEM_ATTRIBUTES = {'attr1': \"default1\"} ITEM_TYPE_NAME sets the first part of an items ID. For the file items, this is \"file\". Therefore, file ID look this this: file:/path . The second part is the name a user assigns to your item in a bundle. Example: ITEM_TYPE_NAME = \"foo\" REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES is a list of attribute names that must be set on each item of this type. If BundleWrap encounters an item without all these attributes during bundle inspection, an exception will be raised. Example: REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES = ['attr1', 'attr2'] Step 3: Implement methods You should probably start with sdict() . Use self.run(\"command\") to run shell commands on the current node and check the stdout property of the returned object. The only other method you have to implement is fix . It doesn't have to return anything and just uses self.run() to fix the item. To do this efficiently, it may use the provided parameters indicating which keys differ between the should-be sdict and the actual one. Both sdicts are also provided in case you need to know their values. block_concurrent() must return a list of item types (e.g. ['pkg_apt'] ) that cannot be applied in parallel with this type of item. May include this very item type itself. For most items this is not an issue (e.g. creating multiple files at the same time), but some types of items have to be applied sequentially (e.g. package managers usually employ locks to ensure only one package is installed at a time).

You can also use bw -a ... to achieve the same effect. BW_COLORS Colors are enabled by default. Setting this variable to 0 tells BundleWrap to never use any ANSI color escape sequences. BW_DEBUG_LOG_DIR Set this to an existing directory path to have BundleWrap write debug logs there (even when you're running bw without --debug ). Debug logs are verbose and BundleWrap does not rotate them for you. Putting them on a tmpfs or ramdisk will save your SSD and get rid of old logs every time you reboot your machine. BW_GIT_DEPLOY_CACHE Optional cache directory for git_deploy items. BW_HARDLOCK_EXPIRY Hard locks are automatically ignored after some time. By default, it's \"8h\" .

By default, this is the string $USER@$HOSTNAME , e.g. john@mymachine . You can use BW_IDENTITY to specify a custom string. (No variables will be evaluated in user supplied strings.) BW_ITEM_WORKERS and BW_NODE_WORKERS BundleWrap attempts to parallelize work. These two options specify the number of nodes and items, respectively, which will be handled concurrently. To be more precise, when setting BW_NODE_WORKERS=8 and BW_ITEM_WORKERS=2 , BundleWrap will work on eight nodes in parallel, each handling two items in parallel. You can also use the command line options -p and -P , e.g. bw apply -p ... -P ... ... , to achieve the same effect. Command line arguments override environment variables. There is no single default for these values. For example, when running bw apply , four nodes are being handled by default. However, when running bw test , only one node will be tested by default. BW_NODE_WORKERS and BW_ITEM_WORKERS apply to all these operations. Note that you should not set these variables to very high values. First, it can cause high memory consumption on your machine. Second, not all SSH servers can handle massive parallelism. Please refer to your OpenSSH documentation on how to tune your servers for these situations. BW_MAX_METADATA_ITERATIONS Sets the limit of how often metadata reactors will be run for a node before BundleWrap calls it a loop and terminates with an exception. Defaults to 1000 . BW_REPO_PATH Set this to a path pointing to your BundleWrap repository. If unset, the current working directory is used. Can be overridden with bw --repository PATH . Keep in mind that bw will also look for a repository in all parent directories until it finds one. BW_SOFTLOCK_EXPIRY Soft locks are automatically removed from nodes after some time.

Locking is an important part of collaborating using BundleWrap. Hard locks Since very early in the history of BundleWrap, what we call \"hard locks\" were used to prevent multiple users from using bw apply on the same node at the same time. When BundleWrap finds a hard lock on a node in interactive mode, it will display information about who acquired the lock (and when) and will ask whether to ignore the lock or abort the process. In non-interactive mode, the operation is always cancelled for the node in question unless --force is used. Soft locks Many teams these days are using a workflow based on pull requests. A common problem here is that changes from a feature branch might already have been applied to a set of nodes, while the master branch is still lacking these changes. While the pull request is open and waiting for review, other users might rightly use the master branch to apply to all nodes, reverting changes made by the feature branch. This can be a major nuisance. As of version 2.6.0, BundleWrap provides \"soft locks\" to prevent this. The author of a feature branch can now lock the node so only they can use bw apply on it: $ bw lock add node1 \u2713 node1 locked with ID B9JS (expires in 8h) This will prevent all other users from changing any items on the node for the next 8 hours. BundleWrap will tell users apart by their BW_IDENTITY . Now say someone else is reviewing the pull request and wants to use bw apply , while still keeping others out and the original author in. This can be done by simply locking the node again as the reviewer. Nodes can have many soft locks. Soft locks act as an exemption from a general ban on changing items that goes into effect as soon as one or more soft locks are present on the node. Of course, if no soft locks are present, anyone can change any item. You can list all soft locks on a node with: $ bw lock show node1 i node1 ID Created Expires User Items Comment \u203a node1 Y1KD 2016-05-25 21:30:25 2016-05-26 05:30:25 alice * locks are awesome \u203a node1 B9JS 2016-05-24 13:10:11 2016-05-27 08:10:11 bob * me too Note that each lock is identified by a case-insensitive 4-character ID that can be used to remove the lock: $ bw lock remove node1 y1kd \u2713 node1 lock Y1KD removed Expired locks are automatically and silently purged whenever BundleWrap has the opportunity.

It then stores locks as files in the node's local file system ( /var/lib/bundlewrap by default). BundleWrap supports managing non-UNIX nodes, too, such as Kubernetes. You can also write your own custom item types to manage hardware. In those situations, BundleWrap has no place to store lock files. You can solve this by designating another regular UNIX node as a \"locking node\": nodes['my.k8s.cluster'] = { 'locking_node': 'my.openbsd.box', 'os': 'kubernetes', 'metadata': { ... }, } my.openbsd.box is the name of another regular node, which must be managed by BundleWrap.

To aid with the transition, BundleWrap 1.6.0 has been released along with 2.0.0. It contains no new features over 1.5.x, but has builtin helpers to aid your migration to 2.0. items.py In every bundle, rename bundle.py to items.py . BundleWrap 1.6.0 can do this for you by running bw migrate . Default file content type The default content_type for file items has changed from \"mako\" to \"text\". This means that you need to check all file items that do not define an explicit content type of \"mako\". Some of them might be fine because you didn't really need templating, while others may need to have their content_type set to \"mako\" explicitly. BundleWrap 1.6.0 will print warnings for every file item affected when running bw test . Metadata merging The merging behavior for node and group metadata has changed. Instead of a simple dict.update() , metadata dicts are now merged recursively. See the docs for details. Metadata processors and item generators These two advanced features have been replaced by a single new mechanism: metadata.py You will need to rethink and rewrite them. BundleWrap 1.6.0 will print warnings for every group that uses metadata processors and any item generators when running bw test . Custom item types The API for defining your own items has changed. Generally, you should be able to upgrade your items with relatively little effort. Refer to the docs for details. Deterministic templates While not a strict requirement, it is highly recommended to ensure your entire configuration can be created deterministically (i.e. remains exactly the same no matter how often you generate it). Otherwise, you won't be able to take advantage of the new functionality provided by bw hash . A common pitfall here is iteration over dictionaries in templates: % for key, value in my_dict.items(): ${value} % endfor Standard dictionaries in Python have no defined order. This may result in lines occasionally changing their position.

It is highly recommended to use git or a similar tool to keep track of your repository. You may want to start doing that right away. At this point you will want to edit nodes.py and maybe change \"localhost\" to the hostname of a system you have passwordless (including sudo) SSH access to. BundleWrap will honor your ~/.ssh/config , so if ssh mynode.example.com sudo id works without any password prompts in your terminal, you're good to go.

To create your first bundle, type: bw repo bundle create mybundle Now that you have created your bundle, it's important to tell BundleWrap which nodes will have this bundle. You can assign bundles to nodes using either groups.py or nodes.py , here we'll use the latter: nodes = { 'node-1': { 'bundles': ( \"mybundle\", ), 'hostname': \"mynode-1.local\", }, } Create a file template To manage a file, you need two things: a file item in your bundle a template for the file contents Add this to your bundles/mybundle/items.py : files = { '/etc/motd': { 'content_type': 'mako', # use the Mako template engine for this file 'source': \"mymotd\", # filename of the template }, } Then write the file template: vim bundles/mybundle/files/mymotd You can use this for example content: Welcome to ${node.name}!

This page describes the helpers available in BundleWrap to manage those secrets without checking them into version control. Most of the functions described here return lazy Fault objects . .secrets.cfg When you initially ran bw repo create , a file called .secrets.cfg was put into the root level of your repo. It's an INI-style file that by default contains two random keys BundleWrap uses to protect your secrets. One for randomly generated passwords, one for symmetric encryption. You should never commit .secrets.cfg . Immediately add it to your .gitignore or equivalent. Derived passwords In some cases, you can control (i.e. manage with BundleWrap) both ends of the authentication process. A common example is a config file for a web application that holds credentials for a database also managed by BundleWrap. In this case, you don't really care what the password is, you just want it to be the same on both sides. To accomplish that, just write this in your template (Mako syntax shown here): database_user = \"foo\" database_password = \"${repo.vault.password_for(\"my database\")}\" In your bundle, you can then configure your database user like this: postgres_roles = { \"foo\": { 'password': repo.vault.password_for(\"my database\"), }, } It doesn't really matter what string you call password_for() with, it just has to be the same on both ends. BundleWrap will then use that string, combine it with the default key called generate in your .secrets.cfg and derive a random password from that. This makes it easy to change all your passwords at once (e.g. when an employee leaves or when required for compliance reasons) by rotating keys. However, it also means you have to guard your .secrets.cfg very closely. If it is compromised, so are all your passwords. Use your own judgement. \"Human\" passwords As an alternative to password_for() , which generates random strings, you can use human_password_for() .It generates strings like Wiac-Kaobl-Teuh-Kumd-40 . They are easier to handle for human beings. You might want to use them if you have to type those passwords on a regular basis. Random bytes password_for() and human_password_for() are meant for passwords. If you need plain random bytes, you can use random_bytes_as_base64_for() . As the name implies, it will return the data base64 encoded. Some examples: $ bw debug -c 'print(repo.vault.random_bytes_as_base64_for(\"foo\"))' qczM0GUKW7YlXEuW8HGPYkjCGaX4Vu9Fja5SIZWga7w= $ bw debug -c 'print(repo.vault.random_bytes_as_base64_for(\"foo\", length=1))' qQ== Static passwords When you need to store a specific password, you can encrypt it symmetrically. The bw pw utility provides command line access to the functions attached to repo.vault , so we'll use it here to generate the encrypted string: $ bw pw --encrypt 'my password' gAAAA[...]mrVMA== You can then use this encrypted password in a template like this: database_user = \"foo\" database_password = \"${repo.vault.decrypt(\"gAAAA[...]mrVMA==\")}\" Files You can also encrypt entire files: $ bw pw --encrypt --file encrypted.file /my/secret.file Encrypted files are always read and written relative to the data/ subdirectory of your repo. If the source file was encoded using UTF-8, you can then simply pass the decrypted content into a file item: files = { \"/secret\": { 'content': repo.vault.decrypt_file(\"encrypted.file\"), }, } If the source file is binary however (or any encoding other than UTF-8), you must use base64: files = { \"/secret\": { 'content': repo.vault.decrypt_file_as_base64(\"encrypted.file\"), 'content_type': 'base64', }, } External commands To retrieve secrets using a local shell command, use vault.cmd : $ bw debug -c \"print(repo.vault.cmd('uname'))\" Linux By default, the stdout of the given command will be decoded to text using UTF-8 and have leading and trailing whitespace stripped. To prevent this, use the as_text and strip parameters: $ bw debug -c \"print(repo.vault.cmd('uname', as_text=False, strip=False))\" b'Linux\\n' The point of using repo.vault.cmd() is that (like the other functions introduced on this page) it will return a lazy Fault object that will call the command only if and when the value is actually needed (e.g. when rendering a file template). Key management Multiple keys You can always add more keys to your .secrets.cfg , but you should keep the defaults around. Adding more keys makes it possible to give different keys to different teams. By default, BundleWrap will skip items it can't find the required keys for . When using .password_for() , .encrypt() etc., you can provide a key argument to select the key: repo.vault.password_for(\"some database\", key=\"devops\") On the command line, bw pw also accepts --key for this purpose. The encrypted data will be prefixed by yourkeyname$... to indicate that the key yourkeyname was used for encryption. Thus, during decryption, you can omit the key= parameter. Rotating keys You can generate a new key by running bw debug -c \"print(repo.vault.random_key())\" . Place the result in your .secrets.cfg . Then you need to distribute the new key to your team and run bw apply for all your nodes. Note that `encrypt()` and `decrypt()` (plus their `file_` counterparts) use symmetric encryption and require manually updating the encrypted text after the key has changed. Reading keys from external sources If you'd rather not have plaintext keys in your .secrets.cfg , you can use key_command instead of key to specify a shell command that will be invoked to retrieve the key. Whitespace around the output will be stripped automatically. [encrypt] key_command = curl localhost:12345/secret If both key and key_command are present, key_command will be ignored.","title":"Handling secrets"},{"location":"guide/secrets/#handling-secrets","text":"We strongly recommend not putting any sensitive information such as passwords or private keys into your repository.

The use_xattrs attribute controls how this is done. If set to True , the attr command on the node is used to store the hash as an extended file system attribute.

Don't forget to set the os attribute of your node to routeros and also set the username and password attributes. routeros = { \"/ip/dns\": { \"servers\": \"8.8.8.8\", }, \"/interface/vlan?name=vlan6\": { \"vlan-id\": \"6\", \"interface\": \"bridge\", \"needs\": { \"routeros:/interface/bridge?name=bridge\", }, }, \"/interface/vlan?name=vlan7\": { \"delete\": True, }, \"/interface/vlan\": { \"purge\": { \"id-by\": \"name\", }, }, \"/interface/bridge?name=bridge\": {}, \"/interface/bridge/port?interface=ether8\": { \"bridge\": \"bridge\", \"needs\": { \"routeros:/interface/bridge?name=bridge\", }, }, \"/interface/bridge/port\": { \"purge\": { \"id-by\": \"interface\", }, }, \"/interface/bridge/vlan?vlan-ids=6\": { \"bridge\": \"bridge\", \"needs\": { \"routeros:/interface/bridge?name=bridge\", }, \"tagged\": { \"ether10\", \"ether11\", \"ether12\", }, \"untagged\": { \"ether13\", \"ether14\", \"ether15\", }, }, \"/interface/bridge/vlan\": { \"purge\": { \"id-by\": \"vlan-ids\", \"keep\": { \"dynamic\": True, }, }, }, \"/interface/bonding?name=LAG1\": { \"mode\": \"802.3ad\", \"slaves\": [\"ether2\", \"ether3\"], \"transmit-hash-policy\": \"layer-3-and-4\", }, \"/interface/bonding\": { \"purge\": { \"id-by\": \"name\", }, }, \"/system/logging?action=remote&topics=critical\": {}, } Note that when configuring an item from a list of things, item names have two parts, separated by a ? character. The first part determines which kind of item is addressed, the second part is a simple key=value query that MUST return exactly one entry. If a list has no single \"primary key\" (such as /system/logging ), use & to add more conditions. For lists of things, the purge option can be used to instruct BundleWrap to remove items it doesn't know about (see the Purging section). For example /interface/vlan addresses all VLAN interfaces (a list of things) and can be configured to purge unmanaged VLANs, whereas /interface/vlan?name=vlan7 configures a specific VLAN. Purging For any lists of things (VLAN interfaces, bonds) the purge option can be enabled: \"/interface/vlan?name=vlan6\": { \"vlan-id\": \"6\", \"interface\": \"bridge\", \"needs\": { \"routeros:/interface/bridge?name=bridge\", }, }, \"/interface/vlan\": { \"purge\": { \"id-by\": \"name\", }, }, The id-by option tells BundleWrap to identify configured items by the specified key. In the above example, BundleWrap searches for all items with item ids starting wih /interface/vlan that contain a name key. It finds /interface/vlan?name=vlan6 and assumes that only one VLAN should be configured and it should have a name of vlan6 . It will then delete any VLANs on the node not matching this selection. For different items, different selection keys are useful. For example for bridge ports, the interface key is often used: \"/interface/bridge/port?interface=ether8\": { \"bridge\": \"bridge\", \"needs\": { \"routeros:/interface/bridge?name=bridge\", }, }, \"/interface/bridge/port\": { \"purge\": { \"id-by\": \"interface\", }, }, Again, the managed items under the /interface/bridge/port path are identified by the interface key and this key is also used to select items to be purged. For some types of items, not all subitems can be deleted. For example /interface/bridge/vlan will also list dynamic VLANs which are not configured and can thus not be removed. They automatically appear/disappear with the bridge ports using them. In these cases, additional attributes can be specified in the keep option. Any item on the node that has any attribute matching the keep filter will also be retained and not purged. \"/interface/bridge/vlan\": { \"purge\": { \"id-by\": \"vlan-ids\", \"keep\": { \"dynamic\": True, }, }, }, Attribute reference See also: The list of generic builtin item attributes BundleWrap will accept any attributes for these items and pass them through to the RouterOS API.

Try running bw apply -i nodename to see which attribute of the item could not be fixed. If that doesn't tell you enough, try bw --debug apply -i nodename and look for the command BundleWrap is using to fix the item in question. Then try running that command yourself and check for any errors. What happens when two people start applying configuration to the same node? BundleWrap uses a locking mechanism to prevent collisions like this. How can I have BundleWrap reload my services after config changes? See canned actions and triggers . Will BundleWrap keep track of package updates? No. BundleWrap will only care about whether a package is installed or not. Updates will have to be installed through a separate mechanism (I like to create an action with the interactive attribute set to True ). Selecting specific versions should be done through your package manager. Is there a probing mechanism like Ohai? No. BundleWrap is meant to be very push-focused. The node should not have any say in what configuration it will receive. Is BundleWrap secure? BundleWrap is more concerned with safety than security. Due to its design, it is possible for your coworkers to introduce malicious code into a BundleWrap repository that could compromise your machine. You should only use trusted repositories and code. We also recommend following commit logs to your repos. The BundleWrap Project Why doesn't BundleWrap provide pre-built community bundles? In our experience, bundles for even the most common pieces of software always contain some opinionated bits specific to local infrastructure. Making bundles truly universal (e.g. in terms of supported Linux distributions) would mean a lot of bloat. And since local modifications are hard to reconcile with an upstream community repository, bundles would have to be very feature-complete to be useful to the majority of users, increasing bloat even more. Maintaining bundles and thus configuration for different pieces of software is therefore out of scope for the BundleWrap project. While it might seem tedious when you're getting started, with some practice, writing your own bundles will become both easy and precise in terms of infrastructure fit.

It defines any number of magic attributes that are automatically processed by BundleWrap. Each attribute is a dictionary mapping an item name (such as a file name) to a dictionary of attributes (e.g. file ownership information). A typical items.py might look like this: files = { '/etc/hosts': { 'owner': \"root\", 'group': \"root\", 'mode': \"0664\", [...] }, } users = { 'janedoe': { 'home': \"/home/janedoe\", 'shell': \"/bin/zsh\", [...] }, 'johndoe': { 'home': \"/home/johndoe\", 'shell': \"/bin/bash\", [...] }, } This bundle defines the attributes files and users .

This is not something you will have to do very often, because there are already implicit dependencies between item types (e.g. all files automatically depend on the users owning them). actions = { 'a': { 'command': 'true', }, 'b': { 'command': 'true', 'after': {'action:a'}, }, } When set up like this, action:b will only run after action:a has been completed. Note that it doesn't matter if action:a is successful or not, that what needs is for. See Selectors for a complete overview of the ways to specify items here. before Just like after , but in the opposite direction. comment This is a string that will be displayed in interactive mode ( bw apply -i ) whenever the item is to be changed in any way. You can use it to warn users before they start disruptive actions. error_on_missing_fault This will simply skip an item instead of raising an error when a Fault used for an attribute on the item is unavailable. Faults are special objects used by repo.vault to handle secrets . A Fault being unavailable can mean you're missing the secret key required to decrypt a secret you're trying to use as an item attribute value. Defaults to False . needs This allows for setting up dependencies between items. Here are two examples: my_items = { 'item1': { [...] 'needs': [ 'file:/etc/foo.conf', ], }, 'item2': { [...] 'needs': [ 'pkg_apt:', 'bundle:foo', ], } } The first item ( item1 , specific attributes have been omitted) depends on a file called /etc/foo.conf , while item2 depends on all APT packages being installed and every item in the foo bundle. Note that unlike after , with needs the depending item will be skipped if the item it depends on fails or is skipped (unless cascade_skip is set to False on that item). See Selectors for a complete overview of the ways to specify items here. needed_by This attribute is an alternative way of defining dependencies. It works just like needs , but in the other direction. There are only three scenarios where you should use needed_by over needs : if you need all items of a certain type to depend on something or if you need all items in a bundle to depend on something or if you need an item in a bundle you can't edit to depend on something in your bundles tags A list of strings to tag an item with. Tagging has no immediate effect in itself, but can be useful in a number of places. For example, you can add dependencies on all items with a given tag: pkg_apt = { \"mysql-server-{}\".format(node.metadata.get('mysql_version', \"5.5\")): { 'tags': [\"provides-mysqld\"], }, } svc_systemd = { \"myapp\": { 'needs': [\"tag:provides-mysqld\"], }, } In this simplified example we save ourselves from duplicating the logic that gets the current MySQL version from metadata (which is probably overkill here, but you might encounter more complex situations). Tags also allow for optional dependencies, since items can depend on tags that don't exist. So for example if you need to do something after items from another bundle have been completed, but that bundle might not always be there, you can depend on a tag given to the items of the other bundle. triggers and triggered In some scenarios, you may want to execute an action only when an item is fixed (e.g. restart a daemon after a config file has changed or run postmap after updating an alias file). To do this, BundleWrap has the builtin atttribute triggers . You can use it to point to any item that has its triggered attribute set to True . Such items will only be checked (or in the case of actions: run) if the triggering item is fixed (or a triggering action completes successfully). files = { '/etc/daemon.conf': { [...] 'triggers': [ 'action:restart_daemon', ], }, } actions = { 'restart_daemon': { 'command': \"service daemon restart\", 'triggered': True, }, } The above example will run service daemon restart every time BundleWrap successfully applies a change to /etc/daemon.conf . If an action is triggered multiple times, it will only be run once. Similar to needed_by , triggered_by can be used to define a triggers relationship from the opposite direction. See Selectors for a complete overview of the ways to specify items here. preceded_by Operates like triggers , but will apply the triggered item before the triggering item. Let's look at an example: files = { '/etc/example.conf': { [...] 'preceded_by': [ 'action:backup_example', ], }, } actions = { 'backup_example': { 'command': \"cp /etc/example.conf /etc/example.conf.bak\", 'triggered': True, }, } In this configuration, /etc/example.conf will always be copied before and only if it is changed. You would probably also want to set cascade_skip to False on the action so you can skip it in interactive mode when you're sure you don't need the backup copy. Similar to needed_by , precedes can be used to define a preceded_by relationship from the opposite direction. See Selectors for a complete overview of the ways to specify items here. skip Set this to True to always skip this item. This is useful if you just want to quickly disable this item to try something or if it's sitting somewhere in a dependency chain and it would be too cumbersome to remove entirely under certain conditions. Note that setting this to True will also change the default for cascade_skip to False . unless Another builtin item attribute is unless . For example, it can be used to construct a one-off file item where BundleWrap will only create the file once, but won't check or modify its contents once it exists. files = { \"/path/to/file\": { [...] \"unless\": \"test -x /path/to/file\", }, } This will run test -x /path/to/file before doing anything with the item. If the command returns 0, no action will be taken to \"correct\" the item. Another common use for unless is with actions that perform some sort of install operation. In this case, the unless condition makes sure the install operation is only performed when it is needed instead of every time you run bw apply . In scenarios like this you will probably want to set cascade_skip to False so that skipping the installation (because the thing is already installed) will not cause every item that depends on the installed thing to be skipped. Example: actions = { 'download_thing': { 'command': \"wget http://example.com/thing.bin -O /opt/thing.bin && chmod +x /opt/thing.bin\", 'unless': \"test -x /opt/thing.bin\", 'cascade_skip': False, }, 'run_thing': { 'command': \"/opt/thing.bin\", 'needs': [\"action:download_thing\"], }, } If action:download_thing would not set cascade_skip to False , action:run_thing would only be executed once: directly after the thing has been downloaded. On subsequent runs, action:download_thing will fail the unless condition and be skipped. This would also cause all items that depend on it to be skipped, including action:run_thing . The commands you choose for unless should not change the state of your node. Otherwise, running bw verify might unexpectedly interfere with your nodes. cascade_skip DEPRECATED: Use before and after instead. There are some situations where you don't want to default behavior of skipping everything that depends on a skipped item. That's where cascade_skip comes in. Set it to False and skipping an item won't skip those that depend on it. Note that items can be skipped interactively or because of bw apply --only or bw apply --skip or because a Fault was unavailable or they were soft-locked on the node or because they haven't been triggered or because one of their dependencies was skipped or because one of their dependencies failed or they failed their unless condition or the skip attribute was set or because an action had its interactive attribute set to True during a non-interactive run The following example will offer to run an apt-get update before installing a package, but continue to install the package even if the update is declined interactively. actions = { 'apt_update': { 'cascade_skip': False, 'command': \"apt-get update\", }, } pkg_apt = { 'somepkg': { 'needs': [\"action:apt_update\"], }, } cascade_skip defaults to True . However, if the item uses the unless or skip attributes or is triggered, the default changes to False . Most of the time, this is what you'll want. when_creating These attributes are only enforced during the creation of the item on the node (this means the first run of bw apply after adding this item to config). They are ignored in subsequent runs of bw apply , and when other (non-when_creating) attributes are changed. Canned actions Some item types have what we call \"canned actions\". Those are pre-defined actions attached directly to an item. Take a look at this example: svc_upstart = {'mysql': {'running': True}} files = { \"/etc/mysql/my.cnf\": { 'source': \"my.cnf\", 'triggers': [ \"svc_upstart:mysql:reload\", # this triggers the canned action ], }, } Canned actions always have to be triggered in order to run. In the example above, a change in the file /etc/mysql/my.cnf will trigger the reload action defined by the svc_upstart item type for the mysql service.","title":"bundles/.../items.py"},{"location":"repo/items.py/#item-types","text":"This table lists all item types included in BundleWrap along with the bundle attributes they understand.

Example: actions = { 'download_thing': { 'command': \"wget http://example.com/thing.bin -O /opt/thing.bin && chmod +x /opt/thing.bin\", 'unless': \"test -x /opt/thing.bin\", 'cascade_skip': False, }, 'run_thing': { 'command': \"/opt/thing.bin\", 'needs': [\"action:download_thing\"], }, } If action:download_thing would not set cascade_skip to False , action:run_thing would only be executed once: directly after the thing has been downloaded. On subsequent runs, action:download_thing will fail the unless condition and be skipped. This would also cause all items that depend on it to be skipped, including action:run_thing . The commands you choose for unless should not change the state of your node. Otherwise, running bw verify might unexpectedly interfere with your nodes.","title":"unless"},{"location":"repo/items.py/#cascade_skip","text":"DEPRECATED: Use before and after instead. There are some situations where you don't want to default behavior of skipping everything that depends on a skipped item. That's where cascade_skip comes in.

Note that items can be skipped interactively or because of bw apply --only or bw apply --skip or because a Fault was unavailable or they were soft-locked on the node or because they haven't been triggered or because one of their dependencies was skipped or because one of their dependencies failed or they failed their unless condition or the skip attribute was set or because an action had its interactive attribute set to True during a non-interactive run The following example will offer to run an apt-get update before installing a package, but continue to install the package even if the update is declined interactively. actions = { 'apt_update': { 'cascade_skip': False, 'command': \"apt-get update\", }, } pkg_apt = { 'somepkg': { 'needs': [\"action:apt_update\"], }, } cascade_skip defaults to True .
