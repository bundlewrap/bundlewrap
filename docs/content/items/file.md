# File items

Manage regular files.

    files = {
        "/path/to/file": {
            "mode": "0644",
            "owner": "root",
            "group": "root",
            "content_type": "mako",
            "encoding": "utf-8",
            "source": "my_template",
        },

# Attribute reference

See also: [The list of generic builtin item attributes](../repo/items.py.md#builtin-item-attributes)

<hr>

## content

May be used instead of `source` to provide file content without a template file.

<hr>

## content_type

How the file pointed to by `source` or the string given to `content` should be interpreted.

<table>
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Effect</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>any</code></td><td>only cares about file owner, group, and mode</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>base64</code></td><td>content is decoded from base64</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>download</code></td><td>file will be downloaded from the URL specified in <code>source</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>binary</code></td><td>file is uploaded verbatim, no content processing occurs</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>jinja2</code></td><td>content is interpreted by the Jinja2 template engine</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>mako</code></td><td>content is interpreted by the Mako template engine</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>text</code> (default)</td><td>will be read and diffed as UTF-8, but offers no template logic</td></tr>
</table>

Downloaded content will be cached in a temporary directory per bundlewrap invocation. If you require a permanent cache,
you can provide a cache folder via the environment variable `BW_FILE_DOWNLOAD_CACHE`. Downloads will wait forever for a
connection and a response (read timeout), unless you set `BW_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT` to the number of seconds to wait.

<hr>

## context

Only used with Mako and Jinja2 templates. The values of this dictionary will be available from within the template as variables named after the respective keys.

<hr>

## delete

When set to `True`, the path of this file will be removed. It doesn't matter if there is not a file but a directory or something else at this path. When using `delete`, no other attributes are allowed.

<hr>

## encoding

Encoding of the target file. Note that this applies to the remote file only, your template is still conveniently written in UTF-8 and will be converted by BundleWrap. Defaults to "utf-8". Other possible values (e.g. "latin-1") can be found [here](http://docs.python.org/2/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings). Only allowed with `content_type` `jinja2`, `mako`, or `text`.

<hr>

## group

Name of the group this file belongs to. Defaults to `'root'`. Set to `None` if you don't want BundleWrap to change whatever is set on the node. If `group` is set to `None` and the file does not exist yet, `group` will be the primary group of the ssh user.

<hr>

## mode

File mode as returned by `stat -c %a <file>`. Defaults to `644`. Set to `None` if you don't want BundleWrap to change whatever is set on the node. If `mode` is set to `None` and the file does not exist yet, `mode` will be `0644`.

<hr>

## owner

Username of the file's owner. Defaults to `'root'`. Set to `None` if you don't want BundleWrap to change whatever is set on the node.  If `owner` is set to `None` and the file does not exist yet, `owner` will be the ssh user.

<hr>

## source

File name of the file template. If this says `my_template`, BundleWrap will look in `data/my_bundle/files/my_template` and then `bundles/my_bundle/files/my_template`. Most of the time, you will want to put config templates into the latter directory. The `data/` subdirectory is meant for files that are very specific to your infrastructure (e.g. DNS zone files). This separation allows you to write your bundles in a generic way so that they could be open-sourced and shared with other people. Defaults to the filename of this item (e.g. `foo.conf` when this item is `/etc/foo.conf`).

See also: [Writing file templates](../guide/item_file_templates.md)

If using `'content_type': 'download'`, this specifies the URL from which the file will be downloaded. The download is done on the machine running `bw` and then uploaded to the node, so the node doesn't need to have access to the URL.

<hr>

## content_hash

Only valid if `content_type` is set to `download`. Specifies a `sha1sum` to compare the downloaded file to. If set, the file will only be downloaded if the remote hash does not match. Hash will be verified after downloading and after uploading to the node.

If not set, bundlewrap will always download the file, then compare the `sha1sum` of the downloaded file to the one currently on the node.

<hr>

## verify_with

This can be used to run external validation commands on a file before it is applied to a node. The file is verified locally on the machine running BundleWrap. Verification is considered successful if the exit code of the verification command is 0. Use `{}` as a placeholder for the shell-quoted path to the temporary file. Here is an example for verifying sudoers files:

<pre><code class="nohighlight">visudo -cf {}</code></pre>

Keep in mind that all team members will have to have the verification command installed on their machines.

<hr>

## test_with

Same as `verify_with`, but called when running `bw test`. You may want to use this if you don't want all your team members to have to have a large suite of tools installed, but still want to verify file integrity with another tool.

The file is verified locally on the machine running BundleWrap. Verification is considered successful if the exit code of the verification command is 0. Use `{}` as a placeholder for the shell-quoted path to the temporary file.

Please note that `bw test` will call both `verify_with` and `test_with`, so there's no need to set both.
