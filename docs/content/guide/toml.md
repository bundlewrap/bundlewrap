# TOML nodes and groups

The primary way to define nodes is in [nodes.py](../repo/nodes.py.md). However, BundleWrap also provides a built-in alternative that you can use to define each node in a [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) file. Doing this has pros and cons, which is why you can choose which way is best for you.

*Pros*

* One file per node
* Node files are machine-readable and -writeable
* Easier on the eyes for nodes with simple metadata

*Cons*

* Does not support [Fault objects](../api/#bundlewraputilsfault)
* Does not support [atomic()](../repo/groups.py.md#metadata)
* Does not support `None`
* Does not support sets or tuples
* More difficult to read for long, deeply nested metadata

## Using TOML nodes

First, you have to make sure your `nodes.py` doesn't overwrite your TOML nodes. Check if your `nodes.py` overwrites the `nodes` dict:

    nodes = {  # bad
        "my_node": {...},
    }

TOML nodes will be added to the `nodes.py` context automatically, so change your `nodes.py` to add to them (or just leave the file empty):

    nodes["my_node"] = {  # good
        ...
    }

Now you are all set to create your first TOML node. Create a file called `nodes/nodenamegoeshere.toml`:

    hostname = "tomlnode.example.com"
    bundles = [
        "bundle1",
        "bundle2",
    ]

    [metadata]
    foo = "bar"

    [metadata.baz]
    frob = 47

And that's it. This node will now be added to your other nodes. You may use subdirectories of `nodes/`, but the node name will always just be the filename minus the ".toml" extension.

## Converting existing nodes

This is an easy one line operation:

    bw debug -n nodenamegoeshere -c "node.toml_save()"

Don't forget to remove the original node though.

## Editing TOML nodes from Python

BundleWrap uses [tomlkit](https://github.com/sdispater/tomlkit) internally and exposes a `TOMLDocument` instance as `node.toml` for you to modify:

    $ bw debug -n nodenamegoeshere
    >>> node.file_path
    nodes/nodenamegoeshere.toml
    >>> node.toml['bundles'].append("bundle3")
    >>> node.toml_save()

For your convenience, `.toml_set()` is also provided to easily set nested dict values:

    >>> node.toml_set("metadata/foo/bar/baz", 47)
    >>> node.toml_save()

This should make it pretty straightforward to make changes to lots of nodes without the headaches of using `sed` or something of that nature to edit Python code in `nodes.py`.

## TOML groups

They work exactly the same way as nodes, but have their own `groups/` directory. `.toml`, `.toml_set()` and `toml_save()` are also found on `Group` objects.

## Using and managing secrets

Due to TOML nodes not supporting python code, BundleWrap supports what we call "magic strings".
These allow you to use secrets in your nodes with just using a special syntax inside a string.

To define magic strings, you need to add a `magic-strings.py` to your repository. It might look like
this example:

```python
@magic_string
def decrypt(string):
    return vault.decrypt(string)
```

In your node you then use the function as follows:

```toml
mysecret = "!decrypt:SecretStringEncryptedBy `bw pw -e`"
```

The part between `!` and `:` is used as the function name, everything after the `:` will be passed
as argument to the called function. Bundlewrap will raise `InvalidMagicStringException` if the
function cannot be found.
